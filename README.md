Scripts-and-Protocols
=====================

Sinha lab community scripts and protocols. 

Contibute
---------

You do not need to be part of the Sinha lab to upload protocols. 

Format
-------

If possible, use [markdown format](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). The reason why markdown format is preferred is that 
1. It becomes easily editable
2. Github automatically formats it for discplay on the site 

If you have it as another format you can upload it, then we can convert it to markdown later.
