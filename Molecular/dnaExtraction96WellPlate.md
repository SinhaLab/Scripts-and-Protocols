#DNA Extraction - 96 Well Plate

*Modified from Siesuke's.*

##Description

This is a quick and dirty method for high-throughput DNA extraction. 

##Time 
About and hour of work and overnight incubation. 

##Materials

2 96 deep well plates *one for balance,which can be re-used* <br/>
Beads *BB pellets work* <br/>
Plate centrifuge <br/>

##Protocol

1. Collect leaf tissue (0.5cm x 0.5 cm) in 96 deep well plates. Young tissue works best.
2. Add beads to each well.
3. Tissue can be stored at -80 &deg; C for later extraction, do not use lid, use parafilm as the lid will crack.
4. If extracting straight away put plate into liquid nitrogen for 5 seconds.
5. Distrupt tissue by paint shaker ~2 mins, or just shake hard by hand.
6. Add 150 &mu;l, DNA extraction buffer to each well .
7. Vortex for 5 seconds.
8. Incubate at room temp for 5 minutes.
9. Add 150 &mu;l isopropanal.
10. Incubate at room temp for 10 minutes.
11. Centrifuge at 2300-2500 rpm for 20 minutes, (*you must balanance with another appropriate wieghted plate*).
12. Remove supernatant *tip upside down quickly and blot on paper towels - take care with this step as is easy to cross contaminate*.
13. Add 150 &mu;l 70% EtOH.
14. Centrifuge at max speed (3000 rpm) for 30 seconds.
15. Remove supernantant same as step 12.
16. Dry pellet by incubation at 55 &deg; *no longer than 5 min*.
17. Add 15 - 200 &mu;l sterilized water/ 10mM Tris.
18. Vortex gently several times.
19. Put at 4&deg;C overnight.
20. Transfer supernatant to new tube or plate, (*you don't have to tranfer to new plate, just don't suck up tissue debris when using*.)
