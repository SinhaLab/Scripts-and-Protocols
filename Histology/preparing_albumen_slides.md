#Preparing albumen slides
##Preparation of Albumin

Add two egg whites to 1200mL of DI.

Stir on magnetic stirrer for 5 minutes.

Add 4mL of concentrated ammonium hydroxide.

Stir for 5 minutes.

Filter through a low-grade filter (ie: coffee filter).

Store albumin in a screw-top glass 
bottle at 4C in the dark.

##Coating Slides

Slides are individually laid out on a slide warmer at a low setting (one box of slides can fit on the larger C.S.&E slider warmer).

A thin layer of albumin is painted onto each slide using a small clean paintbrush.

Slides are allowed to dry on the warming plate overnight at a low setting.

Albumin coated slides are stored at room temperature in the original packaging until needed.
